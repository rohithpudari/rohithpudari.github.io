I am a PhD student in the [FORCOLAB](https://shuiblue.github.io/forcolab-uoft/) and advised by [Prof. Shurui Zhou](https://www.eecg.utoronto.ca/~shuruiz/) at [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/). I am particularly interested in the intersection of Machine learing and software engineering. 
My research focuses on using machine learning techniques to improve software development more efficient and effective, with a particular emphasis on open source communities and platforms. Please find my publications [here](/publications/).

I received my Master's degree from University of Victoria, under the supervision of [Prof. Neil Ernst](https://neilernst.net). 

#### Master's Thesis
My Master's thesis titled 'AI Supported Software Development: Moving beyond Code Completion' can be found [here.](https://dspace.library.uvic.ca/handle/1828/14155)
